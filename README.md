## Django project and call its API:

#### Open a terminal/command prompt window and navigate to the project directory.

#### Activate the virtual environment by running the command: source env/bin/activate (for Unix-based systems) or env\Scripts\activate (for Windows systems).

#### Navigate to the root directory of the project (the directory containing manage.py file).

#### Run the command python manage.py runserver to start the Django development server.

#### Open a web browser and go to the URL http://localhost:8000 to access the homepage of the Django project.


## To call an API using the localhost URL, follow these steps:

#### Open a web browser.

#### In the address bar, type http://localhost:8000/ (replace 8000 with the actual port number if you're running the server on a different port).

#### Add the path to the API endpoint you want to call. For example, if you have an endpoint at http://localhost:8000/api/products/, type /api/products/ after http://localhost:8000/.

#### Press Enter or Return to send the request to the server.

#### The server will process the request and return a response, which will be displayed in the browser.

#### That's it! You should now be able to run the Django server and call an API using the localhost URL.

I have developed different applications for fetching and API, and for the API, I have added the necessary data manually. I will share the final version of the project with you tomorrow after merging the data models in Django.
